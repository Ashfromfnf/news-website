A UFO crashed into the white house and told Elon Musk to stop 5G because it pollutes space
<br><br>
A UFO crashed today into the white house at 04.26 this morning. People are afraid of what will happen next.
<br><br>
“The UFO looked nothing like we expected! We expected it to be round, but it’s not!”
<br>
-Channel19 news.
<br><br>
Channel19 News say that the UFO isn’t actually round! They claim it to be a car shaped thing that has a shiny blue light on top of it. Other people who saw the crash all have different stories. Some say it looked exactly as we expected, some say it even lifted a person into the sky.
<br><br>
10 hours after the attack Elon Musk tweeted out that the aliens would keep him locked up until 5G ends. We ended up being able to get in contact with him and this is what he said:

The SWAT team, the FBI and the military are now trying to find out a way to save Elon Musk safely. Currently we have no contact with Elon, but we hope to get some information soon. Until then it’s advised for you to not get close to the white house as the police thinks it’s an infected area.

<br><br>
Currently a lot of people are in the streets protesting and have even started breaking things. Levi has not said anything about this and has mostly just been running around and eating grass. The co-mayor has said a few words though. 
<br><br>
“We would like everyone to calm down. Levi is a good mayor and will do the town good. In the meantime, we would like there to be peace in the town.” 
<br>
–Co-mayor Terry.
<br><br>
A lot of people are against it, and some have even left the town. The population has gone down by 10% and some of the stores has closed. 
<br><br>
We are not going to say where it is for the town to not get more hate than it already has.

YOU'REBEAUTIFULSometimes my ear feels funny - Heartbreaking story from Man (84)69TITLE69
<h2>
A man at 84 reported a heartbreaking story yesterday.
<br><br>
A man at 84 said a heartbreaking story, it’s all about problems with his ear. 
<br><br>
Ever since he was a child people had always criticized the fact that he was always itching his ear. They would call him mean names and hit him every single day at school. He was often scared to walk to school or walk home in case he met any of his classmates. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
He would try seeing doctors whenever he could to check if he found any solutions, but nothing ever worked. At some point the doctors told him to stop coming, that there wasn’t anything wrong.
<br><br>

<br><br>
When he became 16 he was tired of all the hate comments. He was contemplating suicide but was stopped by an old lady on the road.
<br><br>
Now the man goes around bridges and stops suicides. He has for over 50 years stopped people from committing and has stopped a total of 83 suicides. The man has now unfortunately ended in the hospital and was diagnosed with cancer. The doctors don’t think he has a long time to live.
<br><br>
The people he stopped from taking suicide has paid their respects and has visited him.
<br><br>

We all hope that the man lives his last moments in peace.

YOU'REBEAUTIFULGod just made an Instagram account, What's next? Jesus thirst traps - How will this effect your child69TITLE69
<h2>
As you probably see from the title, God has made an instagram account.
<br>
Instagram has said themselves that they have tried banning the account but to no avail.
<br>
Rumors have started going around that its Instagram themselves that have made the account to “prank” people. Instagram has made it clear that this is not something that they have done. 
<br><br>
<img src="../images/article/god-instagram.png" alt="">
<br><br>
There has been posts such as pictures of the sky with text saying 
<br>
“God is looking at you. Don’t disobey.”
<br>
There has been children getting afraid of these posts and has therefore not wanted to leave the house. Parents are desperate and are afraid of what’s next. Some parents suspect thirst traps, other parents suspect gore and violence.
<br><br>
Instagram has made it clear they aren’t having their main focus on this account. Mostly because they are quite lazy.
<br><br>
A small team from Northern America are trying to find out who’s behind the account but has yet failed. It is a well known account by hackers, and they are wondering how it got there, and why it can’t be banned etc. 
<br><br>
Until then it has been said that if you got small children on instagram you should be careful on what they watch. The god account may pop up.
<br><br>
Instagram can also confirm that this account is made by God or someone with God-like powers due to the telepathic messages that have been received by Adam Mosseri, the CEO of instagram.

YOU'REBEAUTIFULMothers of all ages in disbelief of this new narcotic!69TITLE69
<h2>
Mothers of all ages love this new narcotic. It’s called “monozodiclyde.” This drug is awesome for struggling mothers who is sleep deprived. 
<br><br>
<img src="../images/article/red-pills.jpg" alt="">
<br><br>
It affects the melatonin in the blood and makes you less tired. The downside to this is when the monozodiclyde stops working you become very dizzy and tired over a small amount of time. 
<br><br>
It also affects the mood of the person. It affects the dopamine in your body and usually makes you feel very happy. The downside to this is that when the monozodiclyde stops the person can often feel very down, and can be described as a depressive episode. 
<br><br>
If you consume to much you might start hallucinating or feel like your high. You don’t need a lot of monozodiclyde for it to work. 
<br><br>
Some people are even saying that monozodiclyde might even be used in medicine if made with less side effects. 
<br><br>
This drug became especially known for attracting the mothers out there with children who crate a lot of trouble at home.
<br>
Child protective services have never been this active before. They are saying that children become easily affected by it as well.
<br><br>
“We have found multiple children with their mothers affected by the drug. We are hoping that it doesn’t get worse then it already has”
<br>
-Tyler from Child Protective Services
<br><br>
We hope that the children affected by this is getting the help they need. And if your mother is affected by the drug we highly recommend telling another trusted adult.
