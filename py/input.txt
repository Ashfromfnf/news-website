A UFO crashed into the white house and told Elon Musk to stop 5G because it pollutes space
<br><br>
A UFO crashed today into the white house at 04.26 this morning. People are afraid of what will happen next.
<br><br>
“The UFO looked nothing like we expected! We expected it to be round, but it’s not!”
<br>
-Channel19 news.
<br><br>
Channel19 News say that the UFO isn’t actually round! They claim it to be a car shaped thing that has a shiny blue light on top of it. Other people who saw the crash all have different stories. Some say it looked exactly as we expected, some say it even lifted a person into the sky.
<br><br>
10 hours after the attack Elon Musk tweeted out that the aliens would keep him locked up until 5G ends. We ended up being able to get in contact with him and this is what he said:

The SWAT team, the FBI and the military are now trying to find out a way to save Elon Musk safely. Currently we have no contact with Elon, but we hope to get some information soon. Until then it’s advised for you to not get close to the white house as the police thinks it’s an infected area.

YOU'REBEAUTIFULCow gets drunk, runs for mayor in a small town in Utah and wins69TITLE69
<h2>
<br><br>
A known cow by the name “Levi” ran for mayor in a small town in Utah and won. People have reported seeing the cow drink 50% vodka before the election. This has caused a lot of commotion around the town. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
Currently a lot of people are in the streets protesting and have even started breaking things. Levi has not said anything about this and has mostly just been running around and eating grass. The co-mayor has said a few words though. 
<br><br>
“We would like everyone to calm down. Levi is a good mayor and will do the town good. In the meantime, we would like there to be peace in the town.” 
<br>
–Co-mayor Terry.
<br><br>
A lot of people are against it, and some have even left the town. The population has gone down by 10% and some of the stores has closed. 
<br><br>
We are not going to say where it is for the town to not get more hate than it already has.

YOU'REBEAUTIFULSometimes my ear feels funny - Heartbreaking story from Man (84)69TITLE69
<h2>
A man at 84 reported a heartbreaking story yesterday.
<br><br>
A man at 84 said a heartbreaking story, it’s all about problems with his ear. 
<br><br>
Ever since he was a child people had always criticized the fact that he was always itching his ear. They would call him mean names and hit him every single day at school. He was often scared to walk to school or walk home in case he met any of his classmates. 
<br><br>
<img src="../images/article/bullying.jpeg" alt="">
<br><br>
He would try seeing doctors whenever he could to check if he found any solutions, but nothing ever worked. At some point the doctors told him to stop coming, that there wasn’t anything wrong.
<br><br>
<img src="../images/article/doctor.jpeg" alt="">
<br><br>
When he became 16 he was tired of all the hate comments. He was contemplating suicide but was stopped by an old lady on the road.
<br><br>
Now the man goes around bridges and stops suicides. He has for over 50 years stopped people from committing and has stopped a total of 83 suicides. The man has now unfortunately ended in the hospital and was diagnosed with cancer. The doctors don’t think he has a long time to live.
<br><br>
The people he stopped from taking suicide has paid their respects and has visited him.
<br><br>

We all hope that the man lives his last moments in peace.

YOU'REBEAUTIFULGod just made an Instagram account, What's next? Jesus thirst traps - How will this effect your child69TITLE69
<h2>
As you probably see from the title, God has made an instagram account.
<br>
Instagram has said themselves that they have tried banning the account but to no avail.
<br>
Rumors have started going around that its Instagram themselves that have made the account to “prank” people. Instagram has made it clear that this is not something that they have done. 
<br><br>
<img src="../images/article/god-instagram.png" alt="">
<br><br>
There has been posts such as pictures of the sky with text saying 
<br>
“God is looking at you. Don’t disobey.”
<br>
There has been children getting afraid of these posts and has therefore not wanted to leave the house. Parents are desperate and are afraid of what’s next. Some parents suspect thirst traps, other parents suspect gore and violence.
<br><br>
Instagram has made it clear they aren’t having their main focus on this account. Mostly because they are quite lazy.
<br><br>
A small team from Northern America are trying to find out who’s behind the account but has yet failed. It is a well known account by hackers, and they are wondering how it got there, and why it can’t be banned etc. 
<br><br>
Until then it has been said that if you got small children on instagram you should be careful on what they watch. The god account may pop up.
<br><br>
Instagram can also confirm that this account is made by God or someone with God-like powers due to the telepathic messages that have been received by Adam Mosseri, the CEO of instagram.

YOU'REBEAUTIFULMothers of all ages in disbelief of this new narcotic!69TITLE69
<h2>
Mothers of all ages love this new narcotic. It’s called “monozodiclyde.” This drug is awesome for struggling mothers who is sleep deprived. 
<br><br>
<img src="../images/article/red-pills.jpg" alt="">
<br><br>
It affects the melatonin in the blood and makes you less tired. The downside to this is when the monozodiclyde stops working you become very dizzy and tired over a small amount of time. 
<br><br>
It also affects the mood of the person. It affects the dopamine in your body and usually makes you feel very happy. The downside to this is that when the monozodiclyde stops the person can often feel very down, and can be described as a depressive episode. 
<br><br>
If you consume to much you might start hallucinating or feel like your high. You don’t need a lot of monozodiclyde for it to work. 
<br><br>
Some people are even saying that monozodiclyde might even be used in medicine if made with less side effects. 
<br><br>
This drug became especially known for attracting the mothers out there with children who crate a lot of trouble at home.
<br>
Child protective services have never been this active before. They are saying that children become easily affected by it as well.
<br><br>
“We have found multiple children with their mothers affected by the drug. We are hoping that it doesn’t get worse then it already has”
<br>
-Tyler from Child Protective Services
<br><br>
We hope that the children affected by this is getting the help they need. And if your mother is affected by the drug we highly recommend telling another trusted adult.

YOU'REBEAUTIFULThe world ended in 2001, we’re all just living in a simulation now69TITLE69
<h2>
Some people have broken into a science lab where they have found secret files of 2001. 
<br><br>
Three people have broken into a science lab. They have said themselves the reason they broke in was because they were bored and wanted to do something fun.
<br><br>
“It was gruesome inside. I wish I never went in.”
<br>
 – One of the friends.
<br><br>
From the video footage we have gotten it seems gruesome. One of the main things they found it there was a secret file they had kept hidden from us all. It was a file where they had written all about a simulation. The friends have all posted on their socials a “book” about this. It got taken down, but we got to it before it was taken down. 
This is what was written:
<br><br>
“We didn’t think we would stumble across something like this. We were all just wanting to do something mischievous. Once we entered the lab it was shiny clean, it looked like it had been cleaned just before we entered. There was a lot of offices on each side of the long hallway. It was nicely lit up too. All the offices had glass, so we were lucky no one was at work. We decided to enter one of the offices that looked like a main one. Once we looked through the files, we noticed one with the title '2001 incident.' We quickly took it and continued walking. We went the other way from which we came from, but it looked dirt and looked old as time itself. There were a few cells like rooms. They were badly lit though, and it was hard seeing anything. We were lucky we brought flashlights with us. Most of the cells seemed empty, except one. There was a human like creature in it. I’m not going to well into detail about what we saw, but we immediately ran and didn’t look back once. We ran home and took a breather once we had gotten inside my room. Once we were there, we looked at the file. It talked about how we are living in a simulation. In 2001 a meteor hit earth and some people that was in space had seen it happen. A month afterwards they went back to earth and gathered everything they could. Some of the things being humans. Once brought back to space we were put in labs and in late 2001 we were put in a simulation just like it was on earth. It brought shivers down my spine. Was this as a lie? I didn’t even know what to believe anymore.”
<br>-Millie, Leader of their friend group
<br><br>
That was how one of the people wrote it. All three friends posted their own versions of the experience. This one version was posted by the “leader” of the group. Her name is Millie and has been in more than one abandoned place before.
<br><br>
This next story is from her closest friend Alex who had been there once before.
<br><br>
“I had been there before so getting in wasn’t that hard. The difference in when I was there last time, and this time is that it felt chillier. It felt like something knew we were afraid. As we stepped in a light flickered and this wasn’t abandoned, it was still in use which is why it was weird. Once we got in, we were basically hiding all the time. It felt like the place was haunted. There were noises in the hallways, not voices, but weird noises. Once we got to the main office and Millie and Sofia were looking around at files and such, I saw someone in the hallway. It had the body of a human but looked nothing like one. Once Millie distracted me and I looked back it wasn’t there. I wanted to see if it had run away which is why we checked the other way we didn’t take. And that’s when I saw it again. We all ran quickly away. We went to Millie’s house and looked through the files. It seemed like a joke at first, but it looked professional which made me believe it. We are all living in a simulation. It said that in 2001 a meteor hit earth. You have probably already read Millie’s version of it. We ended up sleeping at Millie’s because we were afraid of going out.”
<br>
-Alex
<br><br>
We also got in contact with Alex where Alex tells us that,
<br><br>
“Don’t go there. They are doing some creepy shit that shouldn’t have gotten out to the public. They have already taken down all three of our posts and Millie has been called by an unknown number more than once.” – Alex.
<br>
-Alex
This last post was posted by Sofie, also known on the internet as the “scared one.” She was originally against going to the lab.
<br><br>
“I tried to tell them not to go in. I was mostly afraid of getting caught by a worker and them telling my dad. Once we got in, I was already scared, we had to sneak in by a window. If there were any workers there, we would have to jump out the window on the second floor. I don’t remember much from the experience. It all seems like a blur for me. I hate getting reminded of it. I still feel like I’m getting followed all the time, and it scared me. I can’t tell anyone either because they’ll call me paranoid. I want it to stop following me..”
<br>
-Sofie
As you can probably tell it seems like Sofie has more a story of getting followed by the thing they found in there. We don’t have any proof of anything yet though. Recent updates tell that all three friends told their parents and Sofie’s parents didn’t believe her and put her in therapy. 
<br><br>
We have no further information about the entire situation. We hope that Millie, Alex and Sofie gets the help they need. And we hope we aren’t in a simulation but who knows?
