            <h2>

<br><br>In recent years, the fragile psyche of the liberal left has been on full display as suicide rates continue to climb across the country. It seems that these soy latte-sipping, safe space-seeking individuals just can't handle the reality of a thriving economy and traditional American values.<br><br>Experts attribute this disturbing trend to the left's inability to come to terms with the fact that President Trump is making America great again. With jobs on the rise and freedom ringing across the nation, it's no wonder that the left is feeling the pressure.<br><br>In a surprising turn of events, it appears that the very individuals who preach tolerance and inclusion are unable to cope with dissenting opinions and the triumph of conservative ideals. Instead of embracing the American spirit of individual responsibility and resilience, they are resorting to drastic measures.<br><br>One can't help but wonder if the incessant consumption of liberal tears has finally caught up with them. It seems that the more they cry, the higher the suicide rates climb. Perhaps it's time for the left to put down their participation trophies, pick up a copy of the Constitution, and learn what it truly means to be an American.<br><br>As our great nation continues to thrive under conservative leadership, it's clear that the liberal left is unraveling at the seams. While we mourn the loss of these misguided souls, let us also take comfort in the fact that their departure from this world allows for the real patriots to flourish.<br><br>So, as we raise our glasses of freedom and celebrate the triumph of conservative values, let us also take a moment to chuckle at the irony of those who couldn't handle the heat. After all, there's no room for snowflakes in the land of the free and the home of the brave. God bless America!
