<h2>
Mothers of all ages love this new narcotic. It’s called “monozodiclyde.” This drug is awesome for struggling mothers who is sleep deprived. 
<br><br>
<img src="../images/article/red-pills.jpg" alt="">
<br><br>
It affects the melatonin in the blood and makes you less tired. The downside to this is when the monozodiclyde stops working you become very dizzy and tired over a small amount of time. 
<br><br>
It also affects the mood of the person. It affects the dopamine in your body and usually makes you feel very happy. The downside to this is that when the monozodiclyde stops the person can often feel very down, and can be described as a depressive episode. 
<br><br>
If you consume to much you might start hallucinating or feel like your high. You don’t need a lot of monozodiclyde for it to work. 
<br><br>
Some people are even saying that monozodiclyde might even be used in medicine if made with less side effects. 
<br><br>
This drug became especially known for attracting the mothers out there with children who crate a lot of trouble at home.
<br>
Child protective services have never been this active before. They are saying that children become easily affected by it as well.
<br><br>
“We have found multiple children with their mothers affected by the drug. We are hoping that it doesn’t get worse then it already has”
<br>
-Tyler from Child Protective Services
<br><br>
We hope that the children affected by this is getting the help they need. And if your mother is affected by the drug we highly recommend telling another trusted adult.
