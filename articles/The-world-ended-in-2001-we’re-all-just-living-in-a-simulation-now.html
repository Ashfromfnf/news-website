<h2>
Some people have broken into a science lab where they have found secret files of 2001. 
<br><br>
Three people have broken into a science lab. They have said themselves the reason they broke in was because they were bored and wanted to do something fun.
<br><br>
“It was gruesome inside. I wish I never went in.”
<br>
 – One of the friends.
<br><br>
From the video footage we have gotten it seems gruesome. One of the main things they found it there was a secret file they had kept hidden from us all. It was a file where they had written all about a simulation. The friends have all posted on their socials a “book” about this. It got taken down, but we got to it before it was taken down. 
This is what was written:
<br><br>
“We didn’t think we would stumble across something like this. We were all just wanting to do something mischievous. Once we entered the lab it was shiny clean, it looked like it had been cleaned just before we entered. There was a lot of offices on each side of the long hallway. It was nicely lit up too. All the offices had glass, so we were lucky no one was at work. We decided to enter one of the offices that looked like a main one. Once we looked through the files, we noticed one with the title '2001 incident.' We quickly took it and continued walking. We went the other way from which we came from, but it looked dirt and looked old as time itself. There were a few cells like rooms. They were badly lit though, and it was hard seeing anything. We were lucky we brought flashlights with us. Most of the cells seemed empty, except one. There was a human like creature in it. I’m not going to well into detail about what we saw, but we immediately ran and didn’t look back once. We ran home and took a breather once we had gotten inside my room. Once we were there, we looked at the file. It talked about how we are living in a simulation. In 2001 a meteor hit earth and some people that was in space had seen it happen. A month afterwards they went back to earth and gathered everything they could. Some of the things being humans. Once brought back to space we were put in labs and in late 2001 we were put in a simulation just like it was on earth. It brought shivers down my spine. Was this as a lie? I didn’t even know what to believe anymore.”
<br>-Millie, Leader of their friend group
<br><br>
That was how one of the people wrote it. All three friends posted their own versions of the experience. This one version was posted by the “leader” of the group. Her name is Millie and has been in more than one abandoned place before.
<br><br>
This next story is from her closest friend Alex who had been there once before.
<br><br>
“I had been there before so getting in wasn’t that hard. The difference in when I was there last time, and this time is that it felt chillier. It felt like something knew we were afraid. As we stepped in a light flickered and this wasn’t abandoned, it was still in use which is why it was weird. Once we got in, we were basically hiding all the time. It felt like the place was haunted. There were noises in the hallways, not voices, but weird noises. Once we got to the main office and Millie and Sofia were looking around at files and such, I saw someone in the hallway. It had the body of a human but looked nothing like one. Once Millie distracted me and I looked back it wasn’t there. I wanted to see if it had run away which is why we checked the other way we didn’t take. And that’s when I saw it again. We all ran quickly away. We went to Millie’s house and looked through the files. It seemed like a joke at first, but it looked professional which made me believe it. We are all living in a simulation. It said that in 2001 a meteor hit earth. You have probably already read Millie’s version of it. We ended up sleeping at Millie’s because we were afraid of going out.”
<br>
-Alex
<br><br>
We also got in contact with Alex where Alex tells us that,
<br><br>
“Don’t go there. They are doing some creepy shit that shouldn’t have gotten out to the public. They have already taken down all three of our posts and Millie has been called by an unknown number more than once.” – Alex.
<br>
-Alex
This last post was posted by Sofie, also known on the internet as the “scared one.” She was originally against going to the lab.
<br><br>
“I tried to tell them not to go in. I was mostly afraid of getting caught by a worker and them telling my dad. Once we got in, I was already scared, we had to sneak in by a window. If there were any workers there, we would have to jump out the window on the second floor. I don’t remember much from the experience. It all seems like a blur for me. I hate getting reminded of it. I still feel like I’m getting followed all the time, and it scared me. I can’t tell anyone either because they’ll call me paranoid. I want it to stop following me..”
<br>
-Sofie
As you can probably tell it seems like Sofie has more a story of getting followed by the thing they found in there. We don’t have any proof of anything yet though. Recent updates tell that all three friends told their parents and Sofie’s parents didn’t believe her and put her in therapy. 
<br><br>
We have no further information about the entire situation. We hope that Millie, Alex and Sofie gets the help they need. And we hope we aren’t in a simulation but who knows?
