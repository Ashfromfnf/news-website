                <br><br>
                Channel19 News say that the UFO isn’t actually round! They claim it to be a car shaped thing that has a shiny blue light on top of it. Other people who saw the crash all have different stories. Some say it looked exactly as we expected, some say it even lifted a person into the sky.

                10 hours after the attack Elon Musk tweeted out that the aliens would keep him locked up until 5G ends. We ended up being able to get in contact with him and this is what he said: <br><br></h2> <img src="../images/article/Elon-Musk-alien-tweet.png" alt="Elon Musk's tweet">

                <h2>
                The SWAT team, the FBI and the military are now trying to find out a way to save Elon Musk safely. Currently we have no contact with Elon, but we hope to get some information soon. Until then it’s advised for you to not get close to the white house as the police thinks it’s an infected area.</h2>
