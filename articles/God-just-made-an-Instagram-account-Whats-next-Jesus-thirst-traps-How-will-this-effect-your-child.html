<h2>
As you probably see from the title, God has made an instagram account.
<br>
Instagram has said themselves that they have tried banning the account but to no avail.
<br>
Rumors have started going around that its Instagram themselves that have made the account to “prank” people. Instagram has made it clear that this is not something that they have done. 
<br><br>
<img src="../images/article/god-instagram.png" alt="">
<br><br>
There has been posts such as pictures of the sky with text saying 
<br>
“God is looking at you. Don’t disobey.”
<br>
There has been children getting afraid of these posts and has therefore not wanted to leave the house. Parents are desperate and are afraid of what’s next. Some parents suspect thirst traps, other parents suspect gore and violence.
<br><br>
Instagram has made it clear they aren’t having their main focus on this account. Mostly because they are quite lazy.
<br><br>
A small team from Northern America are trying to find out who’s behind the account but has yet failed. It is a well known account by hackers, and they are wondering how it got there, and why it can’t be banned etc. 
<br><br>
Until then it has been said that if you got small children on instagram you should be careful on what they watch. The god account may pop up.
<br><br>
Instagram can also confirm that this account is made by God or someone with God-like powers due to the telepathic messages that have been received by Adam Mosseri, the CEO of instagram.
